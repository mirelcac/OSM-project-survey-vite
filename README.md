# Survey Project - Group Project

In this project, we created different types of input forms, resulting In a story sing the input answers in the end. The theme was Halloween.

### The Problem

The main challange this week was perhaps communication and teamwork. We had different schedules, and no matter how we tried to plan who should do what, we ended up with conflicting codes and merges, and we spent approximately half of the time cleaning up the mess instead of building the project.

We also structured our components differently, and this was part of what had to be fixed. The last day, there were so many conflicts that we had to go back to a previous version. Perhaps approving pushes should have been added as a rule in this project.

Codewise, the biggest challenge was displaying the story after the input forms.
